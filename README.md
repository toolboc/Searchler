## What does it do?  ##
It allows you to peruse a catalogue of pretty much everything recorded ever by every musical artist who ever lived using the most excellent [Musicbrainz](http://musicbrainz.org/) database!

But that's not all, it also allows you to playback song results using Youtube as a playback mechanism!

## How to use it ##
Type in the name of an artist and disambiguate down to the album you are interested in.  Click the album and listen! 

Also supports hashtags i.e - #90s #alternative OR #French #progress #rock
